                <p>Everyone’s favorite family of superheroes is back in “Incredibles 2” – but this time Helen (voice of <br>Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of <br>Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life.<br> It’s a tough transition for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby<br> Jack-Jack’s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the<br> family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again—which is<br> easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible.</p>

                <p>Helen Parr, known in the Superworld as Elastigirl, hung up her supersuit to raise the family with husband Bob, leaving their crime-fighting days<br>behind them. But when she’s tapped to lead a campaign to bring the Supers back into the spotlight, she finds she can still bend, stretch and twist<br> herself into any shape needed to solve the trickiest of mysteries. In short, she’s still got it. That’s good news, too, because a new villain has emerged—unlike<br> any they’ve ever seen before.</p>
